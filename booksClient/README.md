# Books Client App

The books client app is a single page application written in plain JS. Since this app is fairly simple, I chose not to introduce a client side framework such as Angular. 

The client app communicates with the books api (found in the booksAPI directory) via a restful API. 

## Starting the Client App

Make sure to start the server before - for more information check out the booksAPI folder.
Clone the repository and cd into the booksClient folder. Follow these steps:

1. NPM Install - install all the dependencies of the client app
```
npm install
```

2. Run dev server
```
npm start
```
This should start a dev server on localhost:3000 and open the browser window.
