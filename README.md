# js-dev-environment

The purpose of this project is to help start a JavaScript development envrionment. It has the starter code for a client app and a restful API. 
The app displayed here is a simple book list app. It has a login/registration page and it shows a list of books and their corresponding information upon login.

On the backend, I used NodeJS and MongoDB. On the frontend I used plain JS. Both the client and the server apps are wired to a unit-test project and production deployment 
scripts. For more information about each project, see the individual readme files in each folder.

For any questions about the project, feel free to message me.
